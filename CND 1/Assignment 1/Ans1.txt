I used ollydb to know the values of EIP and EBP of the program at different situations and used netcat to connect to simpleprogram.exe.
Program is crashing when entering more than 407 characters and 408 bytes.
Used simple trial and error to find the number of characters required to crash the program.
Address where our input begins on stack - 0018f908 and 0018f754.
Address that becomes EIP which contains user input is 0018faa4.
Programmer and write a condition where an error message is displayed if input is more than the desired characters and tell the user to enter only desired number of characters.
Programmer can also trip the input to the desired number of characters.
